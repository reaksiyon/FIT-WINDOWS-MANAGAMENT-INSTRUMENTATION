# Windows Management Instrumentation

This project is made for my internship assignment.

# Info

It is a technology that enables almost every object to be controlled in Windows operating systems and can perform operations and management functions in the operating system. It contains many classes. In each of these classes, there are functions prepared for various purposes.

For better understanding, here are a few examples of what can be done with WMI:

<ul>
<li>You can start a process on the computer.</li>
<li>You can query the records in the event viewer.</li>
<li>You can restart the computer.</li>
<li>You can do this and all similar operations remotely without being at the computer!</li>
<li>For example, you can use the Win32_Process class to start a process.</li>
</ul>

This and hundreds of other classes are ready in WMI libraries to dominate Windows.
